# CodeQL workflow: performs static security analysis using GitHub's CodeQL
# engine. It runs on pushes and pull requests to `main`, and weekly on Sunday
# at 03:00 UTC by the scheduled cron job below. The workflow checks JavaScript
# and TypeScript code and will create security findings in the repository's
# Security tab when issues are detected.
