# Gitleaks False Positives Ignore File
# Add fingerprints of known false positives here
# Generate fingerprints by running: gitleaks detect --report-format json
# Then copy the fingerprint from the report

# Format:
# <fingerprint>:<file>:<line>

# IMPORTANT: Use this file for specific false positives only
# Do NOT add broad patterns here - those belong in .gitleaks.toml allowlist
# Each entry should be a specific fingerprint for a specific line in a specific file

# Example entries (replace with actual fingerprints):
# 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef:apps/web/src/example-config.ts:15
# a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6:docs/API.md:42

# Guidelines for adding entries:
# 1. Verify it's truly a false positive (not a real secret)
# 2. Add a comment explaining why it's safe
# 3. Review these entries periodically

# Test files with example API keys (for documentation):
# Add actual fingerprints here when they're detected
